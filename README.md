# Topspin - Modern Training Planner for Table Tennis üèì

[![Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-work%20in%20progress-yellow.svg)](https://shields.io/)

Topspin is a modern, intuitive training plan creator designed to help **players, coaches, and clubs** structure their practice sessions effectively and achieve peak performance. Inspired by the need for better planning tools and community discussions (shoutout to Reddit supporters!), this project aims to be the ultimate digital companion for your table tennis journey.

The name is a double play: "Topspin" the technique, and reaching the "top" of your game by adding the best "spin" to your training.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status: Under Active Development ‚ö†Ô∏è**

Topspin is currently being built! The features described below represent the initial goals and the exciting future vision. Expect rapid changes, potential bugs, and a project evolving with community feedback. **Your ideas and contributions are highly welcome right from the start!**

---

## The Idea: Why Topspin?

Tired of scribbled notes, messy spreadsheets, or generic fitness apps that don't understand the specifics of table tennis? Topspin aims to provide a **dedicated, flexible, and powerful tool** specifically designed for planning, tracking, and eventually analyzing table tennis training.

Our goal is to help you:

* **Structure your training** effectively.
* **Focus on specific skills** with detailed exercise planning.
* **Stay motivated** by tracking your sessions and progress.
* **Share knowledge** and plans within your club or community.

---

## Current Goal: The MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The initial focus is on creating a solid **Training Plan Maker** with the following core functionality:

* **Plan Creation:**
    * Set a `Name` for your training plan.
    * Add a `Description` outlining the plan's goals.
* **Training Units:**
    * Structure your plan by adding Training Units (e.g., "Tuesday Forehand Focus").
    * Assign a `Name`, `Description`, and `Weekday` to each unit.
* **Detailed Exercises:**
    * Within each unit, list specific exercises.
    * For each exercise, define:
        * `Name` (e.g., "Multiball Forehand Topspin")
        * `Description` (e.g., "Focus on spin variation, 2 positions")
        * `Duration` (e.g., "15 minutes")
        * `Sets` (e.g., "3")
        * `Ball Bucket` required? (`true`/`false`)
* **PDF Export:**
    * Generate a clean, printable PDF of your complete training plan to take to the table or share easily.
    *

## The Future Vision: Roadmap Highlights

Beyond the MVP, Topspin has ambitious goals! We envision a comprehensive platform built progressively:

**Core Enhancements (Free & Open Source Focus):**

* **User Management System:** Securely save, manage, and access your personal training plans.
* **Training Plans Browser:** Discover and potentially share plans within the Topspin community (optional).
* **Mobile Version:** Access and potentially track your training on the go via a dedicated mobile app or responsive web design.
* **Interactive Training Mode:** "Start" training plans with integrated timers, set counters, and step-by-step guidance during your session.
* **Exercise Library:** A built-in library with clear instructions, helpful graphics, and potentially short videos for various table tennis drills.

**Community & Club Features:**

* **Club Support:** Features tailored for coaches managing multiple players or groups within a club.
* **Challenges & Leaderboards:** Friendly competition to motivate players (within clubs or the broader community).
* **Tournament Integration:** Track tournament participation and results alongside training data.

**Potential Premium Features (Supporting Future Development):**

To ensure the long-term development and sustainability of Topspin, we are considering offering advanced features under a commercial model (e.g., subscription or one-time purchase) in the future. The core functionality described above is intended to remain free and open source. Potential premium features could include:

* **Advanced Analytics:** In-depth analysis of your training data, progress visualization over time, identifying strengths and weaknesses.
* **AI Assistant:** Personalized drill suggestions based on your progress, potential posture correction feedback (e.g., via video upload analysis), tactical game analysis insights.
* **Video Analysis Integration:** Link your own training/match videos to specific sessions or exercises for review.
* **Cloud Sync & Backup:** Seamlessly sync your plans and progress across multiple devices with secure online backup.
* **Cross-Player Comparison:** Benchmark your stats against peers or players of similar levels (with robust privacy controls).

*(Disclaimer: The exact split between free and premium features is subject to refinement based on development progress, costs, and community feedback. Our commitment is to keep the core valuable and accessible.)*

##  Technology Stack

The current development focus for the initial **desktop version (MVP)** is based on the Java ecosystem:

* **Desktop Client:** **Java** using the **JavaFX** framework for the user interface. This allows us to build a rich client application for the first iteration.
* **Backend (Planned):** **Spring Boot** (Java) is the anticipated choice for building the backend API. This will handle business logic, data persistence (user management, training plans, etc.), and serve as the foundation for future online, synchronization, and premium features.
* **Database:** (To be decided - likely a relational database like **PostgreSQL**).

**Future Considerations:** While the immediate priority is the JavaFX desktop application, we envision expanding Topspin's reach in the future. Potential directions we are exploring for later stages include:
    * A dedicated **mobile application** (possibly using Dart/Flutter).
    * Evolving towards a **web-based application** (using modern web frontend frameworks) to make Topspin accessible without requiring a local Java installation.
These are longer-term goals and the specific technologies will be evaluated when the time comes.
